# Public Holidays

Overview:

This project is a  react web app to search for holidays in three different countries which are Germany, Ghana and Rwanda using a month,day,country and a year.
This project is a solution to the Public Holidays challenge undertaken by a group of trainees under the Amalitech training programme. The purpose is to test trainees' coding skills and ability to collaborate on projects effectively while helping them develop essential skills in working in teams especially in SCRUM settings.

The Challenge:

The challenge was that AmaliTech currently has 3 main branches: Germany Rwanda, and Ghana and since collaboration on projects and other activities is sometimes a problem
when we don't know the holidays in a particular month in either Germany Rwanda or Ghana,
sometimes, meetings are scheduled on days that are holidays and this creates a huge
problem.Therefore there was the need to build an online platform that will allow the user of the system to track the public holidays in Germany Rwanda, and Ghana.

Requirements:

The team was tasked with the challenge to meet the following requirements in the project; 
•login to the system so that I can have access to the application.

•Reset my password so that I can have access to the system if I lose my password.

•Choose my country, month and day so that I can know if that day of the month is a
holiday in Ghana.

•Choose "any" for either month or day so that the result is not specific to neither a day nor month so that I can know the all the holidays in the country or all the holidays in a particular month if provided.

•Select a single day in a month to see all the holidays for all the countries.

•Log out of the system
